# Introduction :
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
# Dataset :
The dataset can be downloaded from this website. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset. If the code do not viewed it can also be viewed from the website by copying the github url https://nbviewer.org/github/RANJANA20-eng/Bharat-Intern_Task3/blob/main/Iris%20Flower%20Classification.ipynb
# Steps to Classify Iris Flower:
   1. Load the data
   2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
   3. Model training.
   4. Model Evaluation.
   5. Testing the model.
# Applications of Machine Learning:
 1. Speech Recognition: Speech recognition uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to process human speech into written format and vice versa. Some examples are – Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri.
 2. Recommendation Engine: Using the past behavior of a human’s search data the recommendation engine can produce new data to cross-sell products to customers. For example – Amazon product recommendations, Spotify music recommendations.
